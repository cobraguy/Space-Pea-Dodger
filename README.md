# Space-Pea-Dodger
A recreation of my [Space Pea Dodger game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10054599/) in [Phaser](http://phaser.io/).

[Abra](https://aurifexlabs.com/) was used to develop and test the game.

The game is playable on desktop. It should be playable on mobile browsers, however, I have only tested it on my Nexus 7 2013.
The only difference between desktop and mobile is that on desktop, if your mouse leaves the game, it's game over. On mobile you can lift your finger, but it doesn't save you from losing.
___

There are still a couple things I want to do.

1. Add instructions and a game over message (Simply, "Game Over", if they lost, and another message if the mouse left the game)
2. Add a button to play again instead of having to refresh the page
3. **Clean up the code and add comments**
